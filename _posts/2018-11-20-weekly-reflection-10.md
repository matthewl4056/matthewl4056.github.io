In this short week, we were continuing our game that we started a while ago. We continued to find images for our game, as in a background, a target, a player, and a danger for our game. After I was done with finding all the images for my game, I scaled the images to a reasonable size. That was pretty quick because it was not that hard. After scaling the images, I then had to put my images in a certain spot so it will look more like a game. That took a lot of guessing to get the certain images into their own place. After putting the certain images into it's place I was done. One of the challenges that I faced was when it came to getting the images.  Some of them were  easy. But when I was trying to get images for my danger, player, and target that was hard because some of the images were transparent, but when it came out to the background, the image wasn't transparent. So I had to keep getting images to until the images were actually transparent.
