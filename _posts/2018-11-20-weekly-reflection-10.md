In this short week, we were continuing our game that we started a while ago. We continued to find images for our game, as in a background, a target, a player, and a danger for our game. After I was done with finding all the images for my game, I scaled the images to a reasonable size. That was pretty quick because it was not that hard. After scaling the images, I then had to put my images in a certain spot so it will look more like a game.
