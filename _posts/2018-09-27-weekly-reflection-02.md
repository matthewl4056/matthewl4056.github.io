I like is happenning right now. I sort of understand more of what is happening in class. I don't always have to go to my partner for help, just for clarifying questions. But other than that, it has been going well. I did this weekly reflection post thing myself this time, but last week, I had to ask my partner where to go and how to the post. Other than the the questions here and there, it has been going well and I understand most of the things.
