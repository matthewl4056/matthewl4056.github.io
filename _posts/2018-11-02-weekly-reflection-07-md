This week we talked about contracts. We reviewed about what contracts do and how they work. I said that you give the computer something (code) and the computer then gives you what you wanted. I also learned that if we put the code as (big-star purple) the code wouldn't work because you will need another string as a number, or else the computer can't give you your purple star. So if you do (big-star 50 "outline" "purple") We were in introduced function definitions on Monday. The challenge was when it came to understanding when it came to coding the gt with parenthesis. I knew how to do it but I didn't know what to do with the code. But without that everthing was pretty easy.
