This week on Monday we took our midterms. I thought that some of the questions were pretty easy. But some of the other questions was pretty hard. One question that was easy was question 2. The question was What is name of the outermost function in ```(scale 2 (circle 40 "solid" "blue)?. I thought that his question was easy because the answer is in the question and it is the outer function so I can eliminate the answers that was in the inside function. So looking at the outside part of the function I knew that it was scale because 2 is a value and can be changed, but scale is the name of the outermost function and can't be changed, because that is what you want the computer to do with your image. This was a novice question because the answer is right there in the question and it chould be easy to find the answer. Also the proportion corrct in this question is 0.434. This means that almost half the people that took this test got the question correct. But the other half got the question wrong. This week went by pretty fast because all we did revolved around the test.
