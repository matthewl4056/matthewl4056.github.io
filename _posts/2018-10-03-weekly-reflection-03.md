I like what is going on right now in CS. I am getting to know more about coding, I think that it is fun to code. I only have a challenge when it comes to knowing what to put as the code, but when I do know what to put for the code, it becomes more fun because I know what is going on. Right now I understand how to do my weekly posts without having to ask anyone. Other than not knowing what to put in for the codes I think that this class is fun and interesting.
