Part 1: My Flag
The flag that I was assigned to was either the Cuba flag or the Pakistan flag. I chose the Pakistan flag because I didn't think that it would be that hard to do. Of course, I was wrong, it was kind of easy but I was doing my flag and only needed the star that was left. But I didn't realize that there was a white part to the left side of the flag. When I was looking at the flag the white part blended in with the rest of the page because it was white. So I had to restart in order to get the white part of the flag in also.
