The flag that I was assigned to was either the Cuba flag or the Pakistan flag. I chose the Pakistan flag because I didn't think that it would be that hard to do. Of course, I was wrong, it was kind of easy but I was doing my flag and only needed the star that was left. But I didn't realize that there was a white part to the left side of the flag. When I was looking at the flag the white part blended in with the rest of the page because it was white. So I had to restart in order to get the white part of the flag in also. But it didn't take long before I was where I was at before I had to restart. The flag porject in my opinion was pretty fun, I hadn't had acts and craft in a long time. So it was fun to go back a few years back. Some challenges that I have is getting the geometry when it comes to making the flag. The teacher wanted us to make the flag as precise as possible. So I had to get the exact measurement when it comes to these kind of things. Also making to green part of the flag with teh white part of teh flag was hard because the flag was a one to two so I had to measure the exact thing to where the white part of the flag goes and where the green part goes. But besides those things the flag project was easy.
