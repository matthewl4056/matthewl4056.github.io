This week, things has been going well in CS. One connection that I can make to last week's lesson is that when it comes to coding, there are contracts in order for the codes to work. Another connection is that the heading are very important when it comes to coding. For example, when you use the heading <li> you are telling the computer to list an item. Some challenges that I had when it came to this class was when it came to overlapping shapes onto other shapes while coding. I knew how to code shapes but I didn't know how to overlap the shapes. My partner is helping me when I don't know what to do. But other than that the class has been going well.
