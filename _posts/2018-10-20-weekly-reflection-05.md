This week we were learning how to code our flags. Making the shapes was pretty easy. One connection that I was able to make was that it was the same as coding shapes, it was just that now you had to overlay and make the shapes of the flags. It was pretty easy, but for other people, they had to make shapes that they didn't know how to make. For example, there was flags with animals in them, or just a lot of things to overlay. I had no challenges in making the flag because all I had to do was to overlay a red circle onto a white rectangle. One challenge that I did have was when it came to making another flag that needed multiple things to overlay. I didn't have enough time to finish that one. But I did finish my Japan flag pretty easily.
