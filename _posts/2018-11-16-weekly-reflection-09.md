This week, we added on to our knowledge of functions. For November 15th, we asked questions on how to model a rocket blasting off and what we would need to know if we were actually going to model the rocket. We also learned how to do ```(define my-age914))```, on why it was wrong and why it was right. I also learned that a function is when you put it in the computer and that a valve can be changed. There was not that much challenges because most of the things that we did was review. Other than that this week was ok and it wasn't that hard.
